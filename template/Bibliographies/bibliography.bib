During the past decade there has been an accelerating interest in the de velopment of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations ({SDEs}). This activity has been as strong in the engineering and physical sciences as it has in mathematics, resulting inevitably in some duplication of effort due to an unfamiliarity with the developments in other disciplines. Much of the reported work has been motivated by the need to solve particular types of problems, for which, even more so than in the deterministic context, specific methods are required. The treatment has often been heuristic and ad hoc in character. Nevertheless, there are underlying principles present in many of the papers, an understanding of which will enable one to develop or apply appropriate numerical schemes for particular problems or classes of problems.},

	abstract = {This book may be regarded as consisting of two parts. In Chapters I-{IV} we pre sent what we regard as essential topics in an introduction to deterministic optimal control theory. This material has been used by the authors for one semester graduate-level courses at Brown University and the University of Kentucky. The simplest problem in calculus of variations is taken as the point of departure, in Chapter I. Chapters {II}, {III}, and {IV} deal with necessary conditions for an opti mum, existence and regularity theorems for optimal controls, and the method of dynamic programming. The beginning reader may find it useful first to learn the main results, corollaries, and examples. These tend to be found in the earlier parts of each chapter. We have deliberately postponed some difficult technical proofs to later parts of these chapters. In the second part of the book we give an introduction to stochastic optimal control for Markov diffusion processes. Our treatment follows the dynamic pro gramming method, and depends on the intimate relationship between second order partial differential equations of parabolic type and stochastic differential equations. This relationship is reviewed in Chapter V, which may be read inde pendently of Chapters I-{IV}. Chapter {VI} is based to a considerable extent on the authors' work in stochastic control since 1961. It also includes two other topics important for applications, namely, the solution to the stochastic linear regulator and the separation principle.},

This is such a book. Designed for students who have had a general course in probability theory, it covers general topics in the theory of random processes (including measure theory and axiomatization of probability theory) as well as more specialized questions: processes with independent increments, Markov processes and limit theorems for random processes. A significant feature of the book is a unique and beautiful treatment of processes with independent increments, which assumes no prior knowledge of the theory of infinitely divisible laws. A wealth of results, ideas and techniques distinguish this text, one of the first to survey in a rigorous way the more modern results in the theory of stochastic processes and to link them to earlier developments in the subject.

	abstract = {This book gives an introduction to the basic theory of stochastic calculus and its applications. Examples are given throughout the text, in order to motivate and illustrate the theory and show its importance for many applications in e.g. economics, biology and physics. The basic idea of the presentation is to start from some basic results (without proofs) of the easier cases and develop the theory from there, and to concentrate on the proofs of the easier case (which nevertheless are often sufficiently general for many purposes) in order to be able to reach quickly the parts of the theory which is most important for the applications. For the 6th edition the author has added further exercises and, for the first time, solutions to many of the exercises are provided. Apart from several minor corrections and improvements, based on useful comments from readers and experts, the most important change in the corrected 5th printing of the 6th edition is in Theorem 10.1.9, where the proof of part b has been corrected and rewritten. The corrected 5th printing of the 6th edition is forthcoming and expected in September 2010.},
